## Supported Platforms

* This has only been tested on windows.

## Quick Start

Well for started this uses the opengl branch of monogame, something will need to be refenced in your C# project on visual studio to also get this working.

I do plan on making a example app also.

## Limitations

Currently only one graphics control can be created and used at once. I may look in to this at a later date.
